I'm not as talented as you imagined,
	nobody will care your response and slips
		but I do,
	day and night
hold you in my arm
	util my heats fade away,
the guy in your eyes,
	is just be a illusion of emotion
no appearance,no motivation
		just keeping and avoiding finding the truth
life always donate like nature,
but we never reflect on ourselves,
one day , a knock may get to your door
,however it is a gift out of date,
none will be reconginized,
	when everything drop down its fire,
the world will not be the old one any longer,
	for me,
its just a mysterious and advenrural stroy,
	waiting for my tears.....
